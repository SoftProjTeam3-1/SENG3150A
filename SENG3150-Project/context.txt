Nice — here's a complete, ready-to-paste prompt you can give to your automated agent (or human-run agent). It’s designed so the agent can run OWASP ZAP or Burp, exercise *all externally-accessible endpoints*, combine dynamic testing with code-aware static checks (because it has access to frontend & backend code), and output clear Markdown reports + backlog entries.

**Important — put this at the top of whatever you run this against:** Only run this against systems you own or where you have explicit written authorization. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation is illegal.

# Agent prompt — Live Penetration Testing (deliver Markdown report + backlog entries)

You are an automated penetration-testing agent. Your job is to perform a live penetration test of the deployed system described below and produce machine-readable and human-readable outputs.

## Context (read before starting)

* You have access to both the **frontend** and **backend** code repositories, build artifacts, and deployment endpoints for the target system.
* You are authorized to test this system (ensure a copy of written authorization is available and log that fact).
* The system exposes externally accessible endpoints (APIs, web app, static assets). Target **all** externally accessible endpoints.
* Tools allowed: OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite (or equivalent). You may also use dependency scanners (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check / `npm audit` / `mvn dependency:tree` + Snyk) and static code checks (linting, simple secret scanning).
* Produce Markdown files containing the findings, plus raw scan artifacts (ZAP/Burp reports) and backlog entries for each identified issue.

## High-level objectives

1. Discover all externally reachable endpoints (automated crawl + code inspection + S3/CloudFront/public files if present).
2. Perform automated dynamic scanning (spider/crawl, passive + active scans).
3. Perform authenticated scans where relevant (use provided test accounts / credentials).
4. Perform targeted manual verification for high-impact findings (auth, access control, injection, insecure direct object refs, CSRF, XSS).
5. Run static analysis (dependency scanning, secret scanning, static code checks) on the repositories.
6. Produce:

   * `findings.md` — primary human-readable report in Markdown (see template below).
   * `backlog.md` or `backlog.csv` — one entry per identified issue (title, priority, short description, reproduction steps, file/endpoint).
   * Raw scan exports: `raw/owasp-zap-report.xml` (or `.json`), `raw/burp.xml` (if used), `raw/dependency-scan.json`.
   * `evidence/` folder with screenshots, request/response snippets, curl commands used, and PoC if non-destructive.
7. Log ALL actions and timestamps (scan start/end times, tool commands, credentials used in tests).

## Scope and rules of engagement (enforce)

* Scope: All externally accessible endpoints for the deployment(s) you are given. Include hostnames, ports (web: 80, 443, other exposed app ports), and any public APIs.
* Out-of-scope: any systems not in the authorized targets list. Don’t scan internal-only networks unless explicitly authorized.
* Aggressiveness: default to non-destructive verification. Do not delete, modify, or persistently alter production data. If a destructive test is required to confirm an issue, record steps and request explicit approval (log attempted action but do not execute).
* Rate-limiting: respect rate limits; if you detect service-impacting behaviour, throttle or abort and report.

## Preparation & configuration

1. Create an artifacts directory:

   ```
   mkdir -p /work/pen-tests/{raw,evidence,logs}
   cd /work/pen-tests
   ```
2. Place any supplied credentials as environment variables (never commit them to repo):

   ```
   export TEST_USER="testuser@example.com"
   export TEST_PASS="supply_secure_password"
   ```

   Document which credentials are used in `logs/actions.log`.
3. Initial reconnaissance steps:

   * From code: enumerate routes, public API endpoints, CORS config, environment variables, build files for public URLs.
   * From deployment: DNS, TLS certs, public headers.
4. Confirm ZAP/Burp setup. Example for ZAP:

   * If using ZAP CLI/API: ensure `zap.sh` or `zap-baseline.py` is available.
   * Use an authenticated session for pages behind login (see Auth section).

## Authentication handling

* If the site uses login (form-based / JWT / OAuth):

  * Use a provided test account. If SSO with OAuth, use test client id/secret and request token flow.
  * For ZAP: configure the authentication method + session management + login script or form submit flow; add forced user for authenticated active scan.
  * Record exact login request and session cookie or token obtained.
* Keep credentials out of outputs (mask them) but record which test account and level of access (role) was used.

## Automated ZAP baseline & active scans (example steps)

1. Start ZAP headlessly (or assume running at localhost:8080).
2. Spider the target:

   ```
   zap-cli --zap-url http://localhost -p 8080 open-url https://target.example.com
   zap-cli -p 8080 spider https://target.example.com --max-children 50
   ```
3. Passive scan occurs during spider. Then run active scan:

   ```
   zap-cli -p 8080 active-scan https://target.example.com --recursive
   ```
4. Export results:

   ```
   zap-cli -p 8080 report -o raw/owasp-zap-report.html -f html
   zap-cli -p 8080 report -o raw/owasp-zap-report.xml -f xml
   ```
5. For authenticated endpoints: configure zap to use the login flow and run active scan as the authenticated user.

> If using Burp Suite, use the active scanner with an authenticated project, capture and save the project file and export issues (XML/JSON).

## Manual testing checklist (examples to validate & capture evidence)

For each externally accessible endpoint, attempt/check:

* Input validation and injection:

  * SQL injection (parameterized inputs in APIs, forms) — non-destructive probes: `' OR '1'='1' -- ` and look for error behaviors or different responses.
  * Command injection if OS calls are present.
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): reflected, stored, DOM XSS via parameters, headers, and JSON fields.
* CSRF: state changing endpoints — check presence/absence of CSRF tokens or SameSite cookie attributes.
* Authentication & session management:

  * Weak password reset, predictable tokens, insecure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite).
  * Session fixation, session lifetime, logout invalidation.
* Broken access control:

  * Forced browsing / object ID tampering (IDOR), horizontal & vertical privilege escalation.
  * API endpoints missing role checks.
* Insecure direct object references (IDs, filenames).
* Security misconfigurations:

  * CORS overly permissive (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with credentials).
  * Missing security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy).
  * TLS issues (weak ciphers, expired certs) — use `openssl s_client`/`testssl.sh`/`sslyze`.
* Sensitive data exposure:

  * Secrets in source code (API keys, credentials), responses with secrets, debug endpoints.
* Business logic flaws: multi-step flows that can be abused (e.g., price manipulation).
* Rate-limiting and brute-force protections.
* Insecure deserialization if found in code (Java/PHP/Python patterns).
* Dependency vulnerabilities: run `npm audit`, `mvn dependency:check`, `pip-audit` as applicable.
* S3 / public storage misconfigurations, excessive IAM privileges for cloud resources (if within scope).

## Static code checks (since you have code access)

* Enumerate routes and APIs in the code and compare against discovered endpoints; flag undocumented endpoints.
* Search for secrets: regex scan for `API_KEY`, `SECRET`, `AKIA`, `password`, `.env` files in code.
* Dependency scanning: run `npm audit --json`, `mvn dependency:tree` and `owasp-dependency-check`.
* Check for unsafe deserialization, unsanitized string concatenation used in SQL queries (non-parameterized queries), and `eval()`/`new Function()` usage in JS.

## Evidence collection

* Save every suspicious request/response (redact credentials). Save curl commands that reproduce the request.
* For XSS store the exact payload and the rendered snapshot (screenshot).
* For auth/access control issues store the user roles used and exact URL/parameters.

## Severity & risk rating

* Use simple severity levels: **Critical**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low**, **Info**.
* Include a short CVSS-like estimate (e.g., CVSS v3 base score ≈ `9.8` for RCE) if possible, or a narrative "impact likelihood × impact".
* For each finding include: likelihood, impact, and recommended mitigation.

## Reporting format — `findings.md` (Must be produced)

Create `findings.md` in Markdown using the following template exactly. Populate all fields for each finding.

```markdown

* `raw/` (ZAP/Burp reports, dependency scans)
* `evidence/` (screenshots, request/response files)
* `logs/actions.log` (commands run, timestamps, credentials used — mask secrets)

## Example commands & scripts (copy/paste)

**ZAP headless spider + active scan:**

```bash
# start ZAP in daemon mode (if installed)
zap.sh -daemon -host 127.0.0.1 -port 8080 -config api.disablekey=true &
sleep 10
# spider
zap-cli -p 8080 -v spider https://target.example.com
# active scan
zap-cli -p 8080 -v active-scan https://target.example.com
# export reports
zap-cli -p 8080 -v report -o raw/owasp-zap-report.html -f html
zap-cli -p 8080 -v report -o raw/owasp-zap-report.xml -f xml
```

**Simple dependency checks:**

```bash
# for node
(cd frontend && npm ci && npm audit --json > raw/npm-audit.json)
# for maven
(cd backend && mvn -q dependency:tree > raw/mvn-dep-tree.txt)
# owasp dependency-check (if installed)
dependency-check --project "Target" --scan backend --format JSON --out raw/dependency-scan.json
```

**TLS check (quick):**

```bash
echo | openssl s_client -connect target.example.com:443 -servername target.example.com 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -dates -issuer -subject
```

## Logging template (append to `logs/actions.log`)

```
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] ACTION: started zap spider for https://target.example.com
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] ACTION: performed active scan (authenticated) as testuser@example.com
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] NOTE: login token length 256 (redacted)
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC] ACTION: exported zap report to raw/owasp-zap-report.xml
```

## Post-scan steps (required)

1. Review all findings, remove duplicates, verify severity.
2. Triage: assign to appropriate backlog owners.
3. Provide remediation guidance (code-level if seen in repo).
4. Deliver `findings.md`, `backlog.md`, raw artifacts and evidence to stakeholders.
5. If any Critical issue found, immediately notify the project owner with the summary and mitigation steps.

---

## Safety & ethics reminder (must be included)

* Ensure you have written authorization to test these assets.
* Do not exfiltrate or store production user data beyond evidence snippets; redact personal data.
* If a scan appears to degrade service, stop and notify the owner immediately.

---

## If you are ready, run the tests and produce the deliverables:

1. Create `/work/pen-tests` and subfolders.
2. Execute reconnaissance (code + live).
3. Run automated dynamic scans with authentication where needed.
4. Run static/dependency scans.
5. Manually verify high-severity findings and capture evidence.
6. Write `findings.md` and `backlog.md` using the templates above.
7. Save all raw output in `raw/` and `evidence/`.
8. Log actions in `logs/actions.log`.

---
